# Progress Infos for Front-end

## What is implemented

 *Layouts with separated sections and css styling for each individual component
 *React Hooks methods for components
 *Drag and Drop behaviors using react-dnd with HTML 5 backend 
 *Connect to Redux store for state management
 *API utils using axios to communicate with server
 *Using material-ui for messaging components. They are having issue with React 18 and will release a patch soon, for now we are using legacy code which will generate warning while running the app.
 *JsonUtils with logics to recursively add nodes and generate schema (still buggy atm).

## What is missing

 *Rules to drag and drop to tree schema. I created utils/Constants.js for rules configuration. React-dnd provides property `accept` to specify which droppable zone an item can be dropped. To be implementing in future
 
 *Collapsible tree node in schema 
 
 *ACTUS types. If we can have the skeleton for Json Schema implemented properly, I reackon this will be a quick job
